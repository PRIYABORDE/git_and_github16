    Git Workflow:
                    Knowing how to set up a proper Git workflow is critical for coding projects that involve group
                collaboration. If you follow certain procedures, you can always keep a clean working copy of your 
                project through identifying code issues before they become incorporated into the larger project.
                At its essence, this workflow attempts to insulate code bases and prevent problems before they happen.
                 Some of the terms used in Git can seem a bit foreign at first and if you’re working in the command 
                 line it might be tricky to visualize the process. This simple step by step guide to a Git workflow 
                 aims to help give an introductory overview for structuring a group project.
        
        Step 1: Set up a Github Organization
                This will be the core code of your project. It is the central working repository on Github 
                that everyone will draw from.

        Step 2: Fork Organization Repository to Your Personal GitHub
                Next fork the central organization repository to your personal GitHub account. This will be your 
                own copy of the project files.

        Step 3: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine
                Next, create a local copy of these files on your personal machine so you can modify/add to them.
                You do this by navigating to the directory where you wish to store the project and typing the
                 following into the command line (excluding the ‘<’ and ‘>’ symbols):

        Step 4: Create a Branch for your Working Files
                But what if you want to update the project? Where should you make your changes if the master branch
                can only have clean, functional code? Let’s make a new branch to create new features, test things
                out and essentially be the working file. You create a new branch (and move into it) by typing:
                git checkout -b <branch name>
                The -b is important, that is what is creating the new branch. I will be calling this branch that 
                contains our working files ‘feature’ from here on out, but you can call it whatever you like.

        Step 5: Set Remote Repository to the GitHub Organization
                As you continue to work on your project, you will periodically want to incorporate changes from 
                your other team members. Since your GitHub organization is where your functional code is stored,
                you will want to pull from there. In order to set up this link between your local directory on your
                own machine and the GitHub organization repository, you will need to set up a ‘remote’ repository
                (aka a repo that is remote and not located on your local machine). Do this by typing:

                git remote add upstream <url to the organization on GitHub>
                *Be sure the url ends with .git

                ‘Upstream’ is the conventional name chosen for a remote, but it can be anything you like.

                GREAT! You have set up all the building blocks you need for an effective Git workflow. Now lets see 
                it in action.

        Step 6: Get Coding!
                Add those new features, tests, and tweaks (you’re making these changes on the feature branch, right?).
                Once you get to a place where you feel good about the work you’ve done, let’s incorporate it into
                 the project’s code base.
                Before we start this process, be sure to add and commit the files you’ve been working on.

        Step 7: Pull the Most Recent Files From the Organization Repo
                All the steps from here on out are to ensure a clean incorporation of your code into the project’s 
                code base. The goal is to isolate any potential code conflicts by adding safeguards to ensure the 
                project’s code is not harmed by anyone’s contribution.
                You’ve been working in the feature branch, and you’ve added and committed your changes.
                As you’ve been working away, it is safe to assume your team members have incorporated their changes
                 into the project code. Before you add your files/changes to the overall project, you want to make sure your changes don’t conflict with anyone else’s code. To do this, you need to pull down the most recent project files to your local machine so you can make the most up to date comparison.

                The GitHub organization repo is where the latest, functioning code base is stored, so we should 
                pull from there. We already set up a link to this repo in step 5, so now is our chance to utilize 
                it!

                First, move to the master branch by typing:

                git checkout master
                Our master branch is what holds clean, functional code on our local machine, so this is where we 
                pull the most recent changes to. We’re essentially bringing our master branch up to date with what 
                is in the organization repo. We pull the changes from from the organization into our master branch
                 by typing:

                git pull upstream master
                We are pulling changes from our upstream’s (which we set up earlier as the organization repo)
                 master branch.

        Step 8: Merge the Master Branch Into the Feature Branch
                    Now that our master branch is up to date, we want to incorporate all those changes into our 
                    feature branch. Let’s go back to our feature branch by typing:

                git checkout feature
                Now we want to merge all of the code in the master branch into our feature branch. Once we do this, 
                our feature branch contains essentially the entire working code base plus our added features.
                 We make this merge by typing:

                git merge master
                This means merge the master branch into the branch we are currently in (the feature branch).

                If there are any conflicts between the code we’ve created in the feature branch and project overall,
                 we will see them now in the feature branch.

                That is key.
                Any potential code conflicts will be discovered and resolved here on our local machine, in our own 
                working branch, away from the main organization repo. Our code is insulated from harming the overall 
                project and we can fix any problems before they are incorporated into the code base.

        Step 9: Push Your Code to your GitHub Repo
                After you’ve merged the master branch into your feature branch (and potentially sorted out any merge
                conflicts), you’re ready to push your changes up to your GitHub repo. While you’re still in the 
                feature branch, type:
                git push origin feature
     Staging Area:
                    The staging area, also called the index, acts as a middle ground between your working directory 
                and the Git repository. It serves as a holding area for changes that you want to include in your 
                next commit. When you make changes to your files in the working directory, you need to explicitly
                add them to the staging area before they become part of a commit.
                    The staging area allows you to selectively choose which changes you want to 
                include in your next commit. For example, if you have made modifications to multiple files, but 
                only want to commit some of them, you can add only those specific files to the staging area.

    Working Directory:
                    The working directory, also known as the working tree, refers to the directory on your local
                 machine where you are actively making changes to your project files. It contains all the files 
                 and directories that make up your project. You can think of it as your playground, where you 
                 create, modify, and delete files freely.

    Git Repository:
                    The Git repository contains all the commits, branches, and tags associated with your project. 
                It is like a database that stores the complete history of your project. Whenever you make a commit,
                Git creates a new snapshot of your project's state and adds it to the repository.
                    Unlike centralized version control systems, Git is distributed, meaning every user has their 
                own local copy of the entire repository, including the complete history. This architecture enables
                seamless collaboration and allows users to work offline without impacting the shared repository.
                    The repository provides a rich set of tools and commands to visualize the project's history, 
                compare different versions, and manage branches effectively. It also enables you to roll back to 
                a previous commit or create new branches to work on different features or experiments.
